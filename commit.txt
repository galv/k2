Convert license header to "proper" Apache 2 license header.

It comes from here, which the NVIDIA legal team recommends:

https://gist.github.com/Rypac/7349957f95f0713143fda2f3d3bc10c8

Basically, the NVIDIA legal team requires that my code contributions
have an Apache 2 license header. If I were to contribute to an
existing file (which I want to do), I would have to manually change
each file's header for legal compliance. @danpovey said that going
ahead and changing all the file headers to an official Apache 2 header
sounded reasonable.

I used codemod (`pip install codemod`) for this, with the following
script:

```
read -r -d '' replacement << EOM

codemod --exclude-paths build -m -d . --extensions cu,h \
        "Copyright \(c\) (.+) See LICENSE for clarification regarding multiple authors" \
        "$replacement"

codemod --exclude-paths build -m -d . --extensions cmake,py \
        "Copyright \(c\) (.+) authors" \
        "$replacement"
```

Codemod, unlike sed, is interactive. I manually checked that every
replacement made sense. Note that I applied this only to .cu, .h,
.cmake, and .py files.
